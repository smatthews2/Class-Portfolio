#   This is a comment block to communicate to myself and other programmers essential info about this program.
#   This program displays Hello World! to the screen and asks the user for a name and number.


## Single #'s are lines of code meant for you to un-comment and execute. Double ##'s are meant to explain a concept.


print( "Hello World!" )  ## prints Hello World! to the screen

## I can put a comment anywhere in my program

## Try also with  ;  at the end. Does it still run?
#print( "Hello World!");

## Try without using quotes:
#print( Hello World! )

## Try with single quotes:
#print( 'Hello World!')

## The variable inputName will hold a name the user will enter:
#inputName = input( "What's your name?" ) 
#print( "So your name is", inputName )    
    
## The variable inputNum will hold a number the user will enter:
#inputNum = input( "What's your favorite number?" )  


## put together multiple outputs in one print statement:
#print( "So your name is", inputName, "and your number is", inputNum )
